### Here are a few tips for future consideration and recommendation about wildfires based on this dataset.

  - Wildfires can be classified more specifically such as desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, etc. 
  - The wildfire dataset for Puerto Rico and Hawaii need to improve in the future because most of the causes of wildfires in these two areas are defined as “Missing/Undefined”. 
  - Future research projects can combine other subjects such as meteorology to predict lightning. The lightning data should be considered and applied.  
  - Temperature should be more considered. In our previous study, we only analyze the relationship between month and wildfire records. 
  - Research about the wildfire policy in each state.
  - Machine Learning
